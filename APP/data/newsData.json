In a research note published Thursday, ICAP's Walter Zimmermann Jr. shared a chart of the Nasdaq 100 divided by the small-cap Russell 2000, showing that the current divergence between the two gauges is sharper than it was at the height of the dot-com bubble. While Big Tech is immune to almost everything, small-cap stock prices tend to be very sensitive to the very first hints that trouble might be ahead for the U.S. economy, Zimmermann wrote.",
